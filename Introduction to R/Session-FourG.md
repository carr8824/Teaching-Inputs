# Session Four: Presenting Data and Reporting Information

## Overview
In this session, we focus on enhancing our ability to present data effectively. We learn how to utilize advanced data visualization techniques with **ggplot2** and how to create detailed, neatly formatted tables using **kable** and **kableExtra**. These tools are essential for creating compelling reports and presentations that can communicate our findings clearly and persuasively.

## Data Visualization and Reporting
- **ggplot2** is a powerful tool for making custom plots and charts in R. We explore various types of visualizations that can help in representing complex datasets in an intuitive manner.
- **kable** and **kableExtra** are utilized for generating well-formatted tables that enhance the readability and effectiveness of our reports.
