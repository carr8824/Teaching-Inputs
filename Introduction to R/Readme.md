Designed for beginners and those looking to apply R in financial contexts, this nine-hour course offers intensive, interactive learning sessions. It covers the fundamentals of R programming, with a strong focus on financial data management, statistical analysis, data visualization, and result reporting. Whether you're new to programming or aiming to enhance your analytical skills in finance, this course prepares you to handle complex data analysis tasks confidently.


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

- Navigate and utilize R syntax effectively in financial data analysis scenarios.
- Manage, manipulate, and visualize data using R's comprehensive toolset.
- Conduct meaningful statistical analyses and interpret their relevance to finance.
- Create and present insightful analytical reports, incorporating R outputs seamlessly.


## Course Structure

The course is divided into four sessions, each designed to build on the previous, culminating in a robust understanding of R's application in finance.

- **Session One:** Working with Objects and Understanding the Environment

   - Focuses on R's work environment, object management, and basic data types.

- Session Two: Conditionals, Functions, and Loops

   - Introduces control structures, custom functions, and repetitive execution mechanisms to automate tasks.

- Session Three: Data Processing, Simulation, and Structuring

   - Covers data manipulation with **dplyr** and **tidyr**, financial data simulation, and structured data processing techniques.

- Session Four: Presenting Data and Reporting Information

   - Teaches data visualization with **ggplot2** and **kable** for creating compelling reports and presentations.

Slides and exercises accompany each session to reinforce the learned concepts. Tasks are short and focused and should be attempted immediately after covering the material, ideally not exceeding 10 minutes each.
